# Release Notes for Craft CMS 4.4 (WIP)

- Entries fields now have a “Branch Limit” setting, which becomes available when “Maintain hierarchy” is enabled, replacing “Min Relations” and “Max Relations”.

- Renamed the “Editable” asset and entry condition rules to “Savable”. ([#12266](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12266))
- Assets, categories, and entries will now redirect to the last-selected source on their index pages when saved. ([#11996](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11996))

### Accessibility

### Administration
- Conditional layout components are now identified using a condition icon within field layout designers. ([#12250](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12250))

### Development
